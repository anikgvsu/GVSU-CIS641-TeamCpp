# Introduction

The Buddy Bites will be a mobile application designed to blend event planning, culinary exploration, and social interaction into a unified and engaging experience. This app will empower users to take control of their social lives, simplifying event organization while elevating culinary adventures. Buddy Bites will revolve around creating connections, enabling users to establish communities with shared interests and will forge memorable moments together.

At its core, Buddy Bites will provide a user-friendly platform for event planning, allowing individuals to effortlessly create, manage, and customize events. Key features will include event invitations and RSVP management, integration with Google Maps for precise location settings, and dietary preference collection to ensure tailored event menus. Users will also be able to explore an extensive database of recipes via a robust search feature, making culinary discoveries based on their preferences a breeze.

The introduction of communities will add depth to the social experience, enabling users to establish, manage, and invite others to join specific interest groups. These communities will seamlessly integrate with events, facilitating the invitation of multiple communities to gatherings, fostering diverse interactions and enriching experiences. Event suggestions based on user preferences will streamline event planning, while the hangout feature will encourage users to organize casual meetups, strengthening connections.

# Anticipated Technologies

For the front-end development, we will utilize React Native, a widely adopted framework, to create a cross-platform mobile app that runs smoothly on both iOS and Android devices. React Native allows for efficient code sharing and maintains a native-like user interface.

On the back-end, we will rely on Firebase, a comprehensive cloud-based platform. Firebase provides a suite of services, including Firebase Authentication for user registration and security, Firestore for real-time database management, Firebase Cloud Functions for serverless logic, and Firebase Cloud Messaging for push notifications. Firebase will simplify our backend development, ensuring data security, scalability, and real-time updates.

Additionally, we will use Expo, a development platform that will streamline the development and deployment process. Expo offers convenient tools for testing, debugging, and over-the-air updates. Users can access the app through the Expo Go app, simplifying distribution.

We will use a version control system like Git to manage code changes and collaborate with each other.

Together, these technologies form a robust foundation for Buddy Bites, enabling us to provide a user-driven, feature-rich app that blends event planning, culinary exploration, and social interaction seamlessly.


# Method/Approach

For the Buddy Bites project, we will opt for an Agile development methodology, a flexible and iterative approach perfectly suited for our two-member team, each team member sharing the development works.

We will maintain a prioritized backlog of features and user stories in Jira. Short sprints or a continuous flow will enable us to set achievable goals and regularly inspect and adapt our work. 

Daily standup meetings via Zoom and weekly in person meetings will keep us in sync, ensuring that we are aware of each other's progress and any impediments.

Retrospectives after each sprint or at defined intervals will help us fine-tune our processes. With Agile, we will prioritize adaptability and responsiveness to user needs, ensuring that Buddy Bites evolves organically and delivers a high-quality experience to the users.
